    <h3>Cartography II<br /> GEOG 3610/5610<br /> Ana Mojica Myers</h3>
    <h1>Project proposal</h1>
    <p>This project is used to explore the effects of Air pollution and how it influences certain respiratory diseases within the population of Los Angeles, California. Los Angeles is known for its large and continuously growing carbon footprint. It is a noticeably polluted city with visible effects such as smog. There is data that displays an increase of respiratory illnesses and the symptoms produces by illnesses such as asthma and lung infections. A report released by the county of Los Angeles Public Health department stated that “A recent study by the California Air Resources Board estimated that particulate pollution causes over 9,000 deaths in California annually”. Particulate pollution is just one form of air pollutants regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency. There are at least six forms of major air pollutants tracked by the EPA that all play a part in air quality as a whole. These are all influenced by the dense population in Los Angeles and further play part in respiratory illnesses within the city.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><i class="heading">Describing the purpose of the map.</i> The purpose of this map is to identify problems that are linked to Air quality in Los Angeles. Los Angeles has a huge population and is known for its air pollution. I will be exploring if there are specific health related issues that are common in this area and what the correlations is between that and the air quality. Where this data is found- do these people live in hazardous areas? How the population and transportation throughout the city can affect specific areas. This map is intended for anyone interested in the topic or people who are concerned/ curious about these correlations.</li>
        <li><i class="heading">The structure of the map.</i> Geographic features I hope to include in the map is first displaying population density within the Los Angeles area. This will help the viewer realize what areas are extremely populated within this large city. I will overlay that data with connected air quality data. This will show if there is a correlation between populated areas and their air quality. I will then highlight levels of air quality diseases in certain areas. This will allow the viewer to explore the connections between these three factors.</li>
        <li><i class="heading">Data sources:</i> The data for this map will mainly come from Data.gov. I will be using data from United Stated census bureau for population. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention provides data on asthma and cancer rates in the US. I will be using data from the United Stated Environmental Protection Agency for Air quality.</li>
        <li><i class="heading">Methodology:</i> To create this map in ArcGIS I will choose a projection that works with this data. I plan to download all of my data and use one that will correlate in years and scale. I will check to connect the coordinate system used so they are the same. The projection used will have to work with the coordinate system used. The scale of the data I have chosen must match overall. This will help when adding different layers, there will be a universal scale. This will help so there is not error throughout the map. When searching through and adding data I can modify features and adjust the amount of detail if necessary. Looking at the correlation between population data and data discovered about respiratory illnesses. Viewing all data found on air pollution and narrowing down an area that correlates to the data with diseases found in specific populations.</li>
        <li><i class="heading">Timeframe:</i> Below is a display of my potential timeline for the project. </li>
